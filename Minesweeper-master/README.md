# Minesweeper
Minesweeper Game with classes

This is the game of minesweeper using classes.  There is a class to
create the sweeper grid, and there is a class that keeps track of each
individual cell.  This is all written in C++, tested, and debugged.  The
game works perfectly fine except for its auto uncover function(runtime error).
This plays with the user until the game is won or they uncover a mine.
Each turn the user is asked to either uncover, flag, or mark a cell.
