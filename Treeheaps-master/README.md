# Treeheaps
This is a self balancing tree using heaps.  Tested, debugged, and successfully implemented.

The treeheap was successful because even when a trillion elements were inserted the hight was still roughly
60-70 elements high which is extremely good.  No data is lost, no memory is leaked, and self-balancing is successful.
